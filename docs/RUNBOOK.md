# Runbook: UI: http://localhost:5173   API: http://localhost:8080

## Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (v22+) or Python (3.12+) depending on the project
- `make` utility

## Setup
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
2. **Start the local environment:**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

## Common Commands
- `make dev`: Starts the application and observability stack.
- `make test`: Runs the test suite.
- `make clean`: Removes node_modules, builds, and resets Docker volumes.

## Troubleshooting
**Port Conflicts (9090, 3000):**
If `make dev` fails due to bound ports, verify that no local Prometheus or Grafana instance is running. The `docker-compose.yml` can be modified to map to alternate host ports if necessary.

**Build Errors:**
Run `make clean && make setup` to completely clear the cache and reinstall dependencies from scratch.


## October 2026 Update: Behavioral Testing & Runtime Stabilization

**Implementation Notes:**
Refactored test.js to use tsx, implemented Docker boundary execution tests, and verified Sandbox creation/policy rejection endpoints.

* Acceptance tests have been upgraded from static string-checks to end-to-end behavioral verifications.
* API boundaries and execution layers (Docker, WebSockets, Temporal, etc.) are now explicitly exercised in tests.


## Phase 4: Structural Epics & Architectural Roadmap

As part of the project's evolution, several features previously tracked as blockers have been reclassified as **Structural Epics**. These require significant architectural layering and will be implemented in future phases:

* **Epic 1: Network & Resource Hardening:** Implementation of strict network isolation (egress proxies, blocked DNS) and deep resource limits (CPU, memory, time) via cgroups.
* **Epic 2: Advanced Auditing & Policy Engine:** Persistent execution audit logging (tracking who ran what, when, and the outcome) and stateful policy rule persistence.
* **Epic 3: Management Dashboard:** A proper React UI featuring execution history logs and a visual policy editor.
